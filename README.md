# Directed By Women

A little web-app that tells you how many of the films you've watched were directed by women. Try it for yourself at [letterboxd-women-website.vercel.app](https://letterboxd-women-website.vercel.app/), and use [watchlistpicker.com/?u=thaizy/directed-by-women](https://watchlistpicker.com/?u=thaizy/directed-by-women) (or [on Github](https://github.com/GoodbyteCo/Letterboxd-Watchlist-Picker)) to get a random suggestion if you want to watch more women-directed movies. See [womenandhollywood.com](https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/) for more on gender inequality in the film industry.

Note: the site requires that you have a public [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) account. The site uses [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s dataset to determine gender, and may not be accurate. Partly inspired by [James Vaughan's post](https://jamesbvaughan.com/movie-director-genders/) and [accompanying Github project](https://github.com/jamesbvaughan/gender-breakdowns) that does the same thing.
